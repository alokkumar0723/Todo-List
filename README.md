# Todo-List
<br>
<br>
I create Todo App and the lists or tasks that you add won’t be removed when you refresh the page and in this todo app there are also features of pending tasks number and you can also delete all tasks that you have added on single click.
<br>
<br>
As you may know, A to-do list is a list of tasks you need to complete or things you want to do and in our design [Todo List App], there is a content box that holds only the input field with some buttons and text. When you entered some characters and click on the plus (+) button, the list will be added to your tasks list and the number of the pending tasks also be updated.
<br>
<br>
You can also delete each list by clicking on the trash icon, and remember this trash icon only appear on hover on the particular list and delete all tasks with a single click.
<br>
<br>
You may wonder about how these to-do app tasks remain even after refreshing the webpage right? Well, at first, the tasks you’ve added will store in your browser’s local storage and then these lists are retrieved into an HTML file in the form <li> tag using JavaScript.
